  Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a programming language. There are loads of different programming languages out there (Python, Java, C++, Rust, C, etc) and they all basically do the same thing: allow you to write programs that get the computer to do what you want it to do. All programming languages contain the same core concepts (variables, functions, loops, conditional statements, etc) but they all have slightly different ways of expressing these concepts, which is to say, they all have different <b><i>syntax</i></b> and <b><i>APIs</i></b>.

  Like any other programming language, JavaScript can be used to create all sorts of things outside of the web browser, from <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank">native apps</a> to <a href="http://johnny-five.io/" target="_blank">robots</a>, you can even use it to script other programs like the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/scripting.html" target="_blank">Adobe Creative Suite</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/scripts/develop/javascript-objects" target="_blank">Microsoft Office</a>. All that said, JavaScript was originally invented for the Web and it's inside the browser where its creative possabilities really shine!
